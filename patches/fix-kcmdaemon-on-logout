ksyndaemon was not terminated on session logout

I must honestly admit that I do not quite understand why it did not
do it and why it does it now. I suspect the way it was used created
two independent instances of KApplication inside of single process and
the wrong one got information about session termination.

It also provides more clean D-Bus interface limiting KSyndaemon
interface to what it actually offers.
